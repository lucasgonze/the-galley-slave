## Why I Made This Sheet Music

This repository contains my digital transcription of a song in a book titled "William Litten's Fiddle Tunes: 1800-1802." The book was published in 1977 in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, by Hines Point Publishers. As far as I can tell the original had only a single run, maybe self-published by a company that only produced this one title. I came across it in the back stacks of a sheet music store in Boston ("The Beehive: Jazz Hive - No Jive!") around 1982. 

Since then my copy has become badly worn. There seems to be no alternative to it. It's out of print, so I can't buy a new copy. There appear to be no digitized scans, though several academic libraries appear to have listings of hard copy versions. Letting this disappear seems wrong to me. This knowledge and these sounds shouldn't be lost. 

Huntington's publication of Litten's hand-written original kept it alive for me. I hope that my digital version here will do the same for others. 

## Musicology

Litten was a sailor whose duties included fiddling. He kept a notebook of tunes. His notebook wound up in a historical archive in a library in [Nantucket, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket#The_whaling_industry). The researcher who compiled the Hines Book book was Gale Huntington.

Out of the many songs in this book that I have played through, this one is easily the best. Its structure is uneven and varied without being crooked. Litten pulls phrases across bar lines to the point where the meter is almost 6/4 rather than 4/4, then pads the beat counts to maintain a danceable cadence. He has a constant stream of ideas: he never takes a motif and morphs it through a conventional series of transformations. Because there is so much detail I suspect this is an original composition. 

It's not hard to play. What's hard is absorbing the quirks and irregularities. It's like a hand-made woodcut. Everything feels natural to the ear, yet no curve is perfectly round, no line is perfectly straight, no pattern repeats, nothing is predictable.

Regarding the title of the song, I never play this music without wondering who Litten was thinking of. As a working seaman, he was on board with [people enslaved into the galley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_slave). Did he meet someone's eyes?
