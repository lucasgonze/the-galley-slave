This repository contains my digital transcription of a song in a book titled "William Litten's Fiddle Tunes: 1800-1802." The book was published in 1977 in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, by Hines Point Publishers. As far as I can tell the original had only a single run, maybe self-published by a company that only produced this one title. 

It is now out of print. I have searched for the book online, but there are no digitized scans. I am making this song available for fellow historical musicians.

Litten was a sailor whose duties included fiddling. He kept a notebook of tunes. His notebook wound up in a historical archive in a library in [Nantucket, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket#The_whaling_industry). The researcher who compiled the Hines Book book was Gale Huntington.

Out of the many songs in this book that I have played through, this one is easily the best. Its structure is uneven and varied without being crooked. Litten pulls phrases across bar lines to the point where the meter is almost 6/4 rather than 4/4, then pads the beat counts to maintain a danceable cadence. He has a constant stream of ideas: he never takes a motif and morphs it through a conventional series of transformations. Because there is so much detail I suspect this is an original composition. 

It's not hard to play. It's pretty easy, as long as you don't go too fast. What's hard is absorbing the quirks and irregularities. It's like a hand-made woodcut. Everything feels natural to the ear, yet no curve is perfectly round, no line is perfectly straight, no pattern repeats, nothing is predictable.

Regarding the title of the song, I never play this music without wondering who Litten was thinking of. As a working seaman, he was personally acquainted with many [people enslaved into the galley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_slave). Did he meet someone's eyes? 

I came across this book in the back stacks of a sheet music store in Boston around 1982. Since then I have played through many of the songs and my copy has become badly worn. I hope that my digital version will keep it available to others in the same way that Huntington's printed version of Litten's hand-written original kept it alive for me.
