A digital transcription of a song I encountered in William Litten's Fiddle Tunes: 1800-1802. The source is was published in 1977 in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts by Hines Point Publishers, and is now out of print. I came across this book in the back stacks of a sheet music store in Boston around 1982. 

It was manually copied into modern notation from a notebook in a historical archive in a library in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The original transcriber, researcher, author was Gale Huntington. Litten was a sailor employed as a ship's fiddler among his other duties. He kept a notebook of tunes. 

Out of the many songs in this book that I have played, this one is easily the best. Its structure is uneven and varied without being crooked - he pulls phrases across bar lines to the point where the meter is almost 6/4 rather than 4/4, and then evens out the counts to maintain a danceable cadence. He has a constant stream of ideas; he never just takes a theme and morphs it through a common series of transformations.

It's not hard to play. Actually, it's pretty easy, as long as you don't go too fast. What's hard is absorbing the quirks and irregularities. It's like a hand-made woodcut. No circle is perfectly round, no line is perfectly straight, no pattern is perfectly repeated, nothing is predictable. 

Regarding the title of the song, I never play this music without wondering who Litten was thinking of. The music has deep feeling. As a working sailor at the height of slavery, he was personally acquainted with many people enslaved into the galley. Did he meet someone's eyes? I never play this song without thinking about that person and feeling their tragedy.
